# BaseballSimulator
This windows forms application runs a realistic simulation of a baseball game. The scores, strikes, balls and outs are recorded and shown on the screen. Player positions are represented visually and the play description is displayed in real time. This was written with C# and the .NET framework.

My code is primarily written in the cs files under BaseballSimulator/ScoreboardTrials/ScoreboardTrials
